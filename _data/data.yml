        Computer | Data Scientist

studies: 
    - education:
      degree: MSc in Computer Science
      university: University of Bari "Aldo Moro" Curriculum Knowledge Engineering and Machine Intelligence
      time: 2016 - 2021
      details: |
        Thesis about using state of the art Deep Learning and Computer Vision models to solve Object Detection
        and Instance Segmentation tasks for automatic damage estimation.

    - education:
      degree: BSc in Computer Science
      university: University of Bari "Aldo Moro"
      time: 2011 - 2015
      details: |
        Thesis about Web graph Clustering. In this thesis a new methodology 
        for clustering Web pages is discussed, using Random Walks between pages, 
        together with their textual content, to learn vector representations 
        for nodes in the web graph. Url2vec is implemented to extract clusters 
        of pages of the same semantic type. Unlike the clustering algorithms 
        proposed in literature, Url2Vec does not consider a website as a 
        collection of text documents independent from each other, but tries to 
        combine information about the content of the pages and the structure 
        of the website. The experimental results produced proved to be discreet 
        and encouraged to follow the studies in this direction to identify new 
        ways to improve the results achieved in terms of quality.

        tagline: "Association Rule Mining from Spatial Data for Crime Analysis. The aim of this project is to examine data regarding the spatial distribution of crimes committed within a year in the city of Charlotte - NC, USA. There are data collected from about 60,000 crimes, as well as district census data and information on commercial business activities. Therefore, the goal was to apply algorithms for the discovery of Association Rules to search for associations between the available information. The Knowledge Discovery process is applied and filters are applied to select only rules with the type of crime in the consequent, as those rules showed where, at the occurrence of the conditions present in the antecedent of the rule, that specific type of crime is more likely to manifest."
